""""
player have a bank roll
player plays a bet

player goes first in game play

Aim : to get closer to a total value of 21 than the dealer does

Possible Actions :

Stay : stop recieving cards

When player's turn is over, dealer starts hitting until he beats the player or busts i.e. goes over 21

Game endings:
    1> If a player keeps hitting and busts and lose the bet
    2> If after player's turn, dealer hits and computer sum is higher than player sum and is still under 21 >> Dealer beats the Player and Computer wins
    3> If after player's turn, dealer hits and gets busted >> Player wins and his money double.

Special Rules :
    Face cards (Jack, King, Queen) count as a value of 10)
    Aces can count as either 1 or 11 whichever value is preferable to the player
